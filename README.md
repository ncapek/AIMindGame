# AI MindQuest
AI MindQuest is an innovative project that aims to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 to create an interactive, generative therapeutic environment. The concept of this project stems from the intriguing world of Ender's Game, a popular science fiction novel where a young protagonist engages in a game that helps uncover and address deep-seated fears and insecurities.

The motivation behind this project is twofold:

Professional Development: As a Machine Learning Engineer, I'm always seeking to explore the cutting-edge technologies of AI and push the boundaries of what they can do. This project allows me to delve deeper into the functionalities and possibilities offered by LLMs.

Personal Interest: Having been deeply inspired by the use of AI in literature and being a fan of science fiction myself, I wanted to bring to life an aspect of that world. AI MindQuest offers an opportunity to merge my interest in AI, literature, and psychology.

The goal of AI MindQuest is to create a safe, personalized, AI-guided narrative that gradually introduces the user to their fears and insecurities within a controlled environment. The AI will adjust the narrative based on the user's responses, encouraging them to face their issues, providing therapeutic support, and monitoring their progress.

Currently, AI MindQuest is in the inception stage of development. I'm in the process of exploring the technicalities involved, designing the high-level architecture, and laying out the roadmap for the project.

I'm excited to discover how close to the original game one can get using current LLMs.
