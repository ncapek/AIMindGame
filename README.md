# AI MindGame
AI MindGame is an innovative project that aims to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4 to create an interactive, generative therapeutic environment. The concept of this project stems from the intriguing world of Ender's Game, a popular science fiction novel where a young protagonist engages in a game that helps uncover and address deep-seated fears and insecurities.

The motivation behind this project is twofold:

Professional Development: As a Machine Learning Engineer, I'm always seeking to explore the cutting-edge technologies of AI and push the boundaries of what they can do. This project allows me to delve deeper into the functionalities and possibilities offered by LLMs.

Personal Interest: Having been deeply inspired by the use of AI in literature and being a fan of science fiction myself, I wanted to bring to life an aspect of that world. AI MindGame offers an opportunity to merge my interest in AI, literature, and psychology.

Currently, AI MindGame is in the inception stage of development. I'm in the process of exploring the technicalities involved, designing the high-level architecture, and laying out the roadmap for the project.


I'm excited to discover how close to the original game one can get using current LLMs. If feasible, a functional system will eventually be developed.

### Goal of the Mindgame System

The primary objective of the Mindgame system is to serve as a reflective mirror for users, enabling them to dive deep into their subconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Through tailored interactive scenarios, users will not only confront their latent fears and challenges but will also gain profound insights into their emotional responses and patterns of behavior. By immersing users in various situations, the system seeks to heighten self-awareness, allowing them to understand their intrinsic motivations, triggers, and reactions. In this journey of self-exploration, Mindgame aspires to be a tool that aids users in recognizing their emotional landscapes, facilitating personal growth and a deeper understanding of oneself.
