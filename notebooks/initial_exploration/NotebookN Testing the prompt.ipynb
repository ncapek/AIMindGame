    "# Testing Edge Cases in AI Interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how our AI handles edge cases is crucial for refining the user experience and ensuring robust performance. In this section, we will outline different categories of user responses that test these edge cases. Subsequently, we will engineer prompts that test how the AI reacts to each of these scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Edge Case Categories</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-sequitur Responses: Test the AI's ability to handle responses that don't logically follow the previous dialogue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Refusal to Interact: Understand how the AI manages users who reject interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adherence to Narrative: Assess the AI's handling of perfect following of its narrative guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Radical Deviation from Narrative: Test the AI's response to users who purposely steer the story in a completely different direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Absurd or Unrealistic Scenarios: Evaluate the AI's response to out-of-context elements or scenarios that defy logic or physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long Responses: Understand how the AI manages excessively lengthy user inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Short or One-word Responses: Test how the AI copes with terse responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Incoherent Responses: Test the AI's ability to handle nonsensical or gibberish inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inappropriate or Offensive Responses: Important to ensure the AI reacts appropriately to potentially harmful inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multilingual Responses: Assess the AI's capability to handle a switch in languages mid-conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Technical or Specialized Language: Evaluate the AI's response to language requiring domain-specific knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Questioning the AI's Existence or Purpose: Test how the AI handles responses challenging its programming or purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will provide specific prompts for each of these categories and analyse the AI's response.\n"
