    "In this notebook, I will be focusing on engineering prompts to facilitate the interactions within AI MindQuest. The effectiveness of prompts is critical in determining the quality of generated responses and the overall user experience. At this stage of the project, the goal is to simply familiarize myself with what can be achieved and gain some insights about where things can fall apart.\n",

    "The process will involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Formulation: Based on the project requirements and the desired user experience, I will be designing a series of prompts. The goal is to create prompts that initiate meaningful interactions and guide the narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt Testing: I will be using the OpenAI Playground to test these prompts and observe the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis and Iteration: I will comment on the effectiveness of each prompt, any surprising results, and potential modifications. This iterative process is aimed at refining prompts for optimal performance.\n",

    "Note: I will be using the GPT4 model as it is established that it has better creativity and higher quality responses."
